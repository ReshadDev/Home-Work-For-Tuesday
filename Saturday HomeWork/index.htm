<h1 id="front-end" class="front">Front-End</h1>  
       <p id="fron">Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.</p>  
<h1 id="html" class="firsteasy">HTML</h1>
<div class="box1">     
     <p class="hello">The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p> </div> 
<h1 id="css" class="firsteasy">CSS</h1>
<div class="box1"> 
      <p class="hello">Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
      </div>
<h1 id="JavaScript" class="firsteasy">JavaScript</h1>
<div class="box1"> 
      <p class="hello">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries.All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
      </div>
<h1 id="React" class="open">React</h1>
<div class="box1"> 
    <p class="hello">React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.</p>
    </div>
<h1 id="Vue" class="open">Vue</h1>
<div class="box">
     <p class="hell">Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced /vjuː/, like "view) is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only.Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives.The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.</p>
     </div>
<h1 id="TypeScript" class="close">TypeScript</h1>
   <div class="box"> <p class="hell">TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
    TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used,or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="JQuery" class="close">JQuery</h1>
  <div class="box">  <p class="hell">jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.As of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having at least 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library.</p>
